# ttlcache

## About

**ttlcache** â€“ is a simple and efficient in-memory key value storage with TTL for each record.

The key is of uint64 type. Library provides wrappers for common types:

* IntKey
* ByteKey
* Int8Key
* Uint8Key
* Int16Key
* Uint16Key
* Int32Key
* Uint32Key
* Int64Key
* Uint64Key
* BytesKey ([]byte)
* StringKey
* AnyKey (interface{})

`AnyKey` is not suitable for _very_ intensive usage. Consider writing your own hash function if your keys are complex types, 
and you faced performance degradation.

## Installation

`go get -u github.com/cheshir/ttlcache`

## Usage

```
package main

import (
    "github.com/cheshir/ttlcache"
)

const (
    minute = 60 * time.Second
    hour = 60 * minute
)

func main() {
    // How often we need to stop the world and remove outdated records.
	resolution := minute

	cache := ttlcache.New(resolution)
	cache.Set(ttlcache.StringKey("some key"), "value", hour)
	value, ok := cache.Get(ttlcache.StringKey("some key"))
	if !ok {
		// there is no record with key "some key" in the cache. Probably it has been expired.
	}

	fmt.Println(value.(string)) // This is necessary type assertion, because returned value is of interface{} type.
}
```

## Performance

If you're interested in benchmarks you can check them in repository.
Just play with numbers and types and check that library is suitable for your purposes.

`go test -bench=. -benchmem`

For those of us who wants to get sum numbers without downloading unknown stuff (MacBook Pro 16"):
